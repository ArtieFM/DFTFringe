<html><body><h1>DFTFringe Version History</h1>
<ul>
<li> Version v1.0  Initial release</li>
<li> V1.1-beta  corrected saving, inport and export of Mirror dialog with OpenFringe</li> </li>
<li> v1.2-beta
<ul>
<li> Added credits to about</li>
<li> Reduced size of test stand wizard and made it more resizable</li>
<li> Save mirror outlines for loaded interferogram every time the "Done" or "make surface" buttons are used.<br>
Look for saved outline file associated with the loading interferogram and use it if found.</li>
<li> Internal change to how zernike values are computed.  Now using Polar definitions. </li>
<li> Increased zernike terms to 48 using all 6th order terms</li>
<li> Added batch processing of interferograms both manual assist and auto mode.</li>
<li>Added enable all and enable spherical only buttons to Metrics display</li>
<li>Added interferogram wavelength to metrics</li>
<li>Added average of stand/system induced terms to stand astig reporting</li>
</ul>
<li> Version 1.3-beta
<ul><li> Added not keys for editing the outline.</li>
<li> Changed outline help to a button to open a docked help window on the left side.</li>
</li> Corrected logic to save wavefront stats.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>Outline does not always appear on interferogram when processing in batch mode.  Workaround is to rotate the mouse wheel to resize it
when in Manual mode batch.</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
store stand/system induced terms to be used to subtract from average wavefronts.
