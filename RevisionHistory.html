<html><body><h1>DFTFringe Version History</h1>
<ul>
<li> Version v1.0  Initial release</li>
<li> V1.1-beta  corrected saving, inport and export of Mirror dialog with OpenFringe</li> </li>
<li> v1.2-beta
<ul>
<li> Added credits to about</li>
<li> Reduced size of test stand wizard and made it more resizable</li>
<li> Save mirror outlines for loaded interferogram every time the "Done" or "make surface" buttons are used.<br>
Look for saved outline file associated with the loading interferogram and use it if found.</li>
<li> Internal change to how zernike values are computed.  Now using Polar definitions. </li>
<li> Increased zernike terms to 48 using all 6th order terms</li>
<li> Added batch processing of interferograms both manual assist and auto mode.</li>
<li>Added enable all and enable spherical only buttons to Metrics display</li>
<li>Added interferogram wavelength to metrics</li>
<li>Added average of stand/system induced terms to stand astig reporting</li>
</ul>
<li> Version 1.3-beta</li>
<ul><li> Added hot keys for editing the outline.</li>
<li> Changed outline help to a button to open a docked help window on the left side.</li>
<li> Corrected and reworked logic to save wavefront stats. Moved display of stats to under the View Menu</li>
<li> Added tool to jitter size of outline and save wavefronts. This helps determine if the outline is correct. Will enhance it next version.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.4-beta</li>
<ul>
    <li> Added outline helper to shift outlines in auto mode.</li>
    <li> Additional fixes to wavefront stats. </li>
    <li> Added selectable background color to 3D display.</li>
    <li> Added show all 3D wavefronts.</li>
    <li> Corrected bug in writing outlines for center hole outline.</li>

</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.5-beta</li>
<ul>
    <li>Added full sized popup windows to display 3D and contour displays using right click menus</li>


</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.6-beta</li>
<ul><li>Corrected zernike calculating bug introduced in vers 1.2 Should give reliable results once again.</li>
<li> Added software null error tolerance in view menu. </li>
<li> Modified outline boundary slightly to eliminate fringes around mirror after DFT analysis.</li>
<li> Added gamma (contrast) horizontal slider control to DFT tools.</li>
<li> Corrected issues when several wavefronts are loaded and a change propigates thru all with the last one in the list
displaying the correct metrics.Hopefully smoothing remains if enabled.</li>
<li> Gaussian smoothing modified to not include data outise mirror outside board when calculating smoothing just inside the outline.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.6A-beta</li>
<ul><li>Bug fix for star test crash </li>
<li>Bug fix to stop outline from changing on save and restore operations </li>
<li>Bug fix for zernike values computation.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.7-beta</li>
<ul><li>Added cc and null values to report and metrics.</li>
<li>Corrected loading of saved center outline.</li>
<li>Change how igram outline is zoomed into including logic for process center outline.</li>
<li>Added warning to averaging of wavefronts if any have different signs for primary SA</li>
<li>Corrected save and restore of Flip igram horizontal. Deleted it from Preferences and kept it in the mirror config. </li>
<li>changed Metric zernike term values to be read only.</li>
<li>Added loaded igram to report</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.8-beta</li>
<ul><li>Only update selected wavefront/s</li>
<li>Added zernike based editing save and load</li>
<li>Added Foucault and ronchi simulation</li>
<li>Fixed bug in display of ROC in Mirror dialog when changing F number</li>
<li>Fixed metrics and report display of Zernike terms RMS value.</li>
<li>Fixed test stand removal when average files are a different size.  Also fixed the astig report so that text does not overlap
in the contour plot footers.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul><li>Version 1.9-beta</li>
<ul><li>Added elliptical Flat processing</li>
<li>Changed zernike rms values to use sign of term instead of all being positive</li>
<li>Enabled translation support of most text strings</li>
<li>Modified igram and wavefront simulation to use the full zernike set and added import from wavefront button.</li>
</ul></ul>

<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<p>Outline does not always appear on interferogram when processing in batch mode.  Workaround is to rotate the mouse wheel to resize it
when in Manual mode batch.</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
store stand/system induced terms to be used to subtract from average wavefronts.
