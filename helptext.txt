Hello I'm Dale Eason and this is a Quick start guide for DFT Fringe the successor to OpenFringe.

If you are fimiliar with OPenFringe then a lot of this will be familiar to you.  However some
things work differently so I hope it will be useful to you as well.

For detailed info on each of the steps see other help videos.

DFTfringe is a program used to anayze interferograms of Telescope Optics

I assume you alaready have interferograms stored as images on your computer.

So lets get started.

First input the mirror and laser data using the configuration dialog.  Here is an example I already filled out.

Second Open an interferogram and outline the mirror in it.

Outlining is a bit easier than in OPenFringe I think.

When the outline is complete press the done button.

At this point you can simply press the "Compute surface button."

Now you have your first anlaysis completed.


See the other videos for more information.

Thank you for watching and happy analizing.
