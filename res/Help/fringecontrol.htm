<h2> Using the Fringe Control and tracing fringes</h2>
 

<p>You can select points on a fringe using the left mouse button.  The right mouse button will delete a point it is close to.   If you drag the mouse with the left button down then it will place points along the path.  If you drag the mouse with the right button down then it will erase points along the path.

 You can also use 
<a href="keys.htm">Short cut keys</a> to help speed up fringe tracing.
</p>
<p><b> The <i>f</i> key:</b>

<br>
 The <i><b>f</b></i> keyboard key is especially useful. Pressing when
there is only one point on the fringe it will auto trace the whole
fringe. Sometimes you may have to select the dark or light radio button
on the fringe before you press the <i>f</i> key.

</p>
<p>Pressing it when there are multiple points on the fringe will adjust
all the points to the center of the fringe. This is called optomizing a
fringe.
</p>
<h3> Auto fringe finding of all fringes.</h3>

To Search for all fringes at once: <br>
Note:  works only when no fringes have been defined.  If there are fringes press the delete all fringes before trying using the <i>auto select all fringes technique</i>.
<ol>

  <li>  Select point on first fringe</li>

  <li>
  Select second point so that blue line is across the whole interferogram and perpendicular to the middle
  of the fringes.</li>

  <li>Select find all fringe buttons.</li>

</ol>

<p> It is not always perfect and you may have some editing to do. But
it does speed up the process a lot. You can select light, dark or both
fringes for this. </p>
<h3>Inserting fringes between two other fringes</h3>

Use the <i>v key</i> or the <i>e</i> key to change the selected
fringe (highlighted in blue.) Insert will add a new fringe in front of
the currently selected fringe. It will add only one point (a blue '+'.)
You can then either press the <i>f</i> key to have the computer find the rest of the fringe or you can trace it yourself with the left mouse button.
<h3>Append to current fringe</h3>

  To append to current fringe hold down left shift key when left clicking to add a point.
  It will try to find a fringe segment and add it to the current fringe.
  After this operation type the <i>f</i> key or click on auto trace/optomize
