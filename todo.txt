wizards batch,

check accuracy against openFringe using simulated igrams.

Mirror dialog saves readable by openFringe.

Check that sign of conic is same for all in the average.

dftarea getgreyimage.  Center of center outline should be center of center circle

mirror dialog does not read OPenFringe oln files correctly.

QT saved wavefront is upside down when read by OpenFringe and DFT.


WHen more than one wavefront is loaded program can hang when switching between them.

Large wavefront does not display well.  OGL is missing.


Why do I need to decrease the radius of the mask by one after unwrapping vortex.

stand rotation -135 and 135 went the same direction.

Central obstruction look 2x too big.

So what is the difference between reducing mask and recompute? Reducing mask Did not recompute zernike.
need to reduce the mask radius by 2 when using vortex.  But do not know why yet.

simulated igram analysis leaves a fringe around the left half edge of the mirror.

show null wavefront when deleting last wavefront in list.

grey error limit does not work right.
