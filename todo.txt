Mirror dialog saves not readable by openFringe.

Check that sign of conic is same for all in the average.

dftarea getgreyimage.  Center of center outline should be center of center circle

mirror dialog does not read OPenFringe oln files correctly.

QT saved wavefront is upside down when read by OpenFringe and DFT.
