wizards batch,

check accuracy against openFringe using simulated igrams.

Mirror dialog saves not readable by openFringe.

Check that sign of conic is same for all in the average.

So what is the difference between reducing mask and recompute? Reducing mask Did not recompute zernike.
need to reduce the mask radius by 2 when using vortex.  But do not know why yet.

simulated igram analysis leaves a fringe around the left half edge of the mirror.  It needs the outline
shifted right and down one pixel.  But then that shows the outline shifted offset as well.

why is intensity profile jagged?

Fringe on zernike based display.  How can that be?  Mask has to be wrong or generator has to be wrong.

Add average of stand only wavefronts to the wavefront list.

smoothing drops out when recomputing because of center obstruction changes.
